Column Name,Data Purpose,Data Role,Data Type,Consolidation Type,Definition,Comments
customer_ID,Dimension,ID,String,Count,"A unique identifier for the customer. Represented as a string of numbers which is assigned to each 
policyholder in the dataset.",
shopping_pt,Dimension,Input,String,Count,"Unique identifier for the shopping point of a given customer. Can be useful for predicting the 
policyholder's likelihood of purchasing a policy from Allstate",
record_type,Measure,Target,String (Boolean),Count,"0=shopping point, 1=purchase point (variable to be predicted). ",It's the target that we are going to predict as a decision (yes/no).
day,Dimension,Input,String,Count,"Day of the week (0-6, 0=Monday). Can be used to predict any seasonal pattern in the behavior the 
policy holders",
time,Dimension,Input,Date/Time,Count/Mean/Time Difference,Time of day (HH:MM). Can be used to better understand time pattern of the policyholders,"For easing the prediction analysis, maybe we should separate 
this field into several fields (date, time) or even get rid of time."
state,Dimension,Input,String,Count,State where shopping point occurred.,It's a two-letters code.
location,Dimension,Input,String,Count,Location ID where shopping point occurred.,We need to change type in Tableau Prep
group_size,Dimension,Input,Numeric (Integer),Count/Average/Median,"How many people will be covered under the policy (1, 2, 3 or 4), provides information about the size 
and composition of the policyholder's household",
homeowner,Dimension,Input,String (Boolean),Count,"Whether the customer owns a home or not (0=no, 1=yes). Binary variable that indicates whether or not 
the policyholder owns a home",
car_age,Dimension,Input,Numeric (Integer),Count/Average/Median,Age of the customer’s car. Numerical variable that represents the age of the vehicle in years,
car_value,Dimension,Input,String,Count,"How valuable was the customer’s car when new. Value of the vehicle associated with the insurance 
policy at a particular shopping point in time","It's represented in terms of a letter grade system. Maybe we can 
convert it to a numeric system 0-10 to reduce the number of dummy 
variables for regression?

risk_factor,Dimension,Input,String,Count,"An ordinal assessment of how risky the customer is (1, 2, 3, 4). This can predictive the likelihood of 
making an insurance claim","There is a 36% fraction of rows with N/A in this field. What should we do with them?
We decided to leave it as NA without 0 replacing

age_oldest,Dimension,Input,Numeric (Integer),Count/Average/Median,"Age of the oldest person in customer's group. Its a numerical variable that represents the age of the 
oldest individual in the policyholder's household. This variable may take on integer values ranging from 18 to 75.","There are some rows that have age_oldest = age_youngest. 
Maybe it's worth seeing how many rows contain difference 
between this two fields. If the number of such columns isn't high,
 there is a sense to substitute both of these columns with one 
called 'estimated age' that assumes values from one of two 
initial fields."
age_youngest,Dimension,Input,Numeric (Integer),Count/Average/Median,"Age of the youngest person in customer’s group. Its a numerical variable that represents the age of the 
youngest individual in the policyholder's household. This variable may take on integer values ranging from 16 to 75",See comment for field 'age_oldest'. Get dr. Flatto approve
married_couple,Dimension,Input,String (Boolean),Count,"Does the customer group contain a married couple (0=no, 1=yes). A binary variable that indicates whether 
the policyholder is part of a married couple.",

variable that indicates the number of previous insurance coverage the policyholder had.","There is a Null instead of 0 so we need to correct it. Do we need it? 
I think we need to keep it as NA because we have no proves that all nulls mean 0
