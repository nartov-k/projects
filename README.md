# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi, this is Kirill. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Cross-Market Insurance Customer Prediction (Cross-Market_Pred)]
- **Objective**: 1. To find patterns of customer purchases based on EDA and Visualizations; 2. Prepare the dataset for model building; 3. To find an ML algorithm that provides better binary predictive results out of five: Logarithmic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- **Data Source**: The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?resource=download). It contains 12 attributes and 381K observations.
- **Tools Used**: 1. Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Skikit); 2. Tableau.
- **Findings**:  1. The list of insights resulting from the EDA phase was found (*EDA_Visualizations folder*). 2. The dataset was enriched with 3 new features and resampled to avoid negative bias during model the building phase; 3. The random Forest model was picked as the best-performing one out of 5 tested algorithms based on the ROC_AUC, accuracy, and precision measures. (*Models_Permormance_Measures folder*).

### Project 2: [Title]
- Similar structure as Project 1.

## How to Use
- To run the notebooks, you will need Jupyter Notebook software. To install Jupyter, you can use Python's package manager, pip. First, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Then, open your command line or terminal and run the following command: `pip install notebook`. This command will install Jupyter Notebook. After installation, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser, where you can run the notebooks.
