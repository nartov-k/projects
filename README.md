# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi, this is Kirill. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Cross-Market Insurance Customer Prediction (Cross-Market_Pred)]
- **Objective**: 1. To find patterns of customer purchases based on EDA and Visualizations; 2. Prepare the dataset for model building; 3. To find an ML algorithm that provides better predictive results.
- **Data Source**: The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?resource=download). It contains 12 attributes and 381K observations.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Skikit); Tableau.
- **Findings**:  1. The list of insights resulting from the EDA phase was found (*EDA_Visualizations folder*). 2. The dataset was enriched with 3 new features and resampled to avoid negative bias during model the building phase; 3. The random Forest model was picked as the best-performing algorithm out of 5 tested algorithms based on the ROC_AUC measure (*Models_Permormance_Measures folder*).

### Project 2: [Title]
- Similar structure as Project 1.

## How to Use
- Instructions on how to install any necessary libraries and run the Notebooks.

## Visualizations
- Screenshots or links to visualizations created in the projects.
